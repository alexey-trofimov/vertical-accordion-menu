## Vertical Accordion Menu

Vertical menu with dropdown submenus (*Accordion*). This type of menu is perfect for creating menus for mobile devices, as well as vertical menus for sidebars.

A **demo** of the menu is available here: [Menu Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.net/vertical-accordion-menu/). Demonstration in **Cyrillic** (**Russian** language): [Menu in Russian](https://demo.minimalweb.net/vertical-accordion-menu/russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*Google fonts:* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) (400, 400 Italic, 500, 500 Italic, 600, 600 Italic, 800).

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to use this menu if you want to add it to your project, since using this prefix will reduce the chance of conflicts with your project's styles.

### Thanks so much:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) - A modern alternative to CSS resets.
- [Font Awesome Free Icons](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font Awesome is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators (*v6.2.1*).
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) (400, 400 Italic, 500, 500 Italic, 600, 600 Italic, 800).

Created with **love** in 2023. Author: [Alexey Trofimov](https://minimalweb.net/). Feel free to use this menu in your projects ;)
